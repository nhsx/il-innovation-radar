<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Innovation Radar is a list of promising technology areas, sorted by how far they are from being ready to build on.

The closer to the centre a technology is, the more suitable it is for building production capabilities on.

Typically the Innovation Lab will work with a technology to assess (or prove) that it is ready to move from one ring to another.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; 
  Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose. 
  Risks and trade-offs are well understood, and implementation is in reach of a generalist delivery or project team.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; 
  Technologies that have seen success in solving a real problem, but are not yet available as off-the-shelf solutions. 
  Accuracy, precision, and reliability are starting to be well understood, but domain-specific knowledge may be needed to 
  successfully combine the parts necessary for a successful implementation.
  </li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; 
  Technologies that are promising, but are immature.  These technologies may have recently emerged from research and may have
  a small number of sources in the marketplace or community, but are as yet unproven in general use or have no immediately apparent application.
  Accuracy, precision, reliability, and other engineering factors may not be clear, but it may be appropriate to measure them.
  </li>
<li><strong>AVOID</strong> &mdash; 
  Technologies recommended not to be used. 
  These may be technically mature and well-supported in the marketplace, but with significant implementation downsides.
  They may also be too immature to realistically assess.
  </li>
</ul>
